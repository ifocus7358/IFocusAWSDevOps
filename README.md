==============

Github branching strategy::


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dac55b58-d16d-4049-8a2b-4c3a8f979999)

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.02.24

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

release/2025.02.24

hotfix branch:: always created from main or master branch only for production fixes.once production fix done we should merged directly to main or master branch only.

always created this hotfix branch for production issues fixes

bugfix:: this branch is created from release branch to fix the LLE(lower level environemnt)/Pre-Prod/UAT/Non-Prod issues and once LLE issues fixed ,we should pushed their changes to release branch only.

=============

1. completely we have occupied this session is issues resolutions and we will continue new topic in next session


27/02/2025::
============

If multiple developers OR DevOps Engineers are working on same Project/MOdules, if they tried to commits thier code changes to Repository, it will faces the  conflicts issues and how to resolved those conflicts issues in real time projects 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc72ca5-a9fd-407b-9d37-48824e5375b7)

Avoide conflicts:: Before pushing the code changes to github repository, make sure, you should be run the command -->git pull

>git pull --->git pull command is use, copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory (local directory) and merged code changes from remote repository to local repository 
>git fetch ---->The git fetch command only fetch the changes into your local Git repo and it will not merged anything. just fetch the details

Please create A,B,C directories in your local machine and clone the project code separately 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e786310-5092-4975-9eb9-7b18801353d8)

Editor steps for Resolved the conflicts::

editor::

1.press i from your keyboard, INCERT
2.press the esc from your keyboard at top left corner 
3.shift+:

Jenkins Introductiion::

Jenkins is a free and open source automation server/tool. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

<img width="846" alt="jenkins overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffb9a0c8-0a8c-4b43-953e-36cd17297716" />

Jenkins is a Orchestration tool

Jenkins is a CI/CD tool

Jenkins is a Schedular

Jenkins is a crone job schedular 


Continuous Integration(CI)::the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple Developers into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository,after which automated builds and tests are run automatically.

developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git,A continuous integration automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately using jenkins Orchestration.

Continuous Delivery (CD)::Continuous Delivery is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production in a consistent and reliable manner. The key distinction of continuous delivery is that the process of deploying the code to production is done manually by a human decision-maker.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3be0abd-12cf-49a5-b1e5-e56d54ac1080)



Continuous Deployment(CD) :: Continuous Deployment is an extension of continuous delivery. With continuous deployment, every change that passes through the automated tests and builds is automatically deployed to production without any human intervention. The deployment process is fully automated.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03cd5335-7656-4b39-80c3-e7ba7a0234a9)


Roles And Responsibilities::

1)The devops engineer was responsibility to release the product to the market as soon as possible
2)release the product speed to the market
3)Devops engineer was give continues feedback to the developers
4) Devops engineer responsibility start from git and end with production

A) when your activity start from git and end with production environment(production servers)Continues deployment
when your activity start from git to LLE(lower level environment,testing environment,pre-prod…et) environment(pre-production servers)Continues delivery non-production environment

I'm going to created one free style job and configured Post-build Actions

In post build Action select the option Archive the artifacts

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup
Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary

>ls target 

Post build action stage

Select archive the artifact
--target/*.jar

Junit test results::
--target/surefire-reports/*.xml

3.For every company will do sequence build on one project this is recommended approach

Please read and understand the below important point for parallel execuion job::
==================================================================================

When this option is checked, multiple builds of this project may be executed in parallel.
By default, only a single build of a project is executed at a time — any other requests to start building that project will remain in the build queue until the first build is complete.
This is a safe default, as projects can often require exclusive access to certain resources, such as a database, or a piece of hardware.

But with this option enabled, if there are enough build executors available that can handle this project, then multiple builds of this project will take place in parallel. If there are not enough available executors at any point, any further build requests will be held in the build queue as normal.

Enabling concurrent builds is useful for projects that execute lengthy test suites, as it allows each build to contain a smaller number of changes, while the total turnaround time decreases as subsequent builds do not need to wait for previous test runs to complete.
This feature is also useful for parameterized projects, whose individual build executions — depending on the parameters used — can be completely independent from one another.


I want to build the project using  Execute shell::
====================================================
at Build step select the Execute shell

Pipelines Introduction:::

A Jenkins pipeline is a series of automated steps or stages that define the process of continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) for your code. Jenkins, being a popular open-source automation server, uses pipelines to automate tasks like building, testing, and deploying code.

There are two types of Jenkins pipelines:

1. Declarative Pipeline
2. Scripted Pipeline

1. Declarative Pipeline::
The declarative pipeline syntax is simpler and more structured. It's the recommended style for most users because it's easy to read and maintain

Here's an example of a simple declarative pipeline:

pipeline{

agent any

stages{

Stage ('Clone'){

steps{

// write code
}
}

Stage ('Build'){
steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Test'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}
Stage ('Execute test casea and get the results'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Generated Artifact'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

Stage ('Deploy'){

steps{

// write code
}
// write code

}

// write code

}

}

Please try to create one pipeline job in jenkinsfile and execute the below Declarative pipeline example:;


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'feature/2025.02.27', url: 'git@github.com:parasa7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Test Results Reports') {
            steps {
                junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Artifacts') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}



Key elements in the declarative pipeline:::
======================================
pipeline: This is the top-level structure.
agent: Specifies where the pipeline will run, such as on any available agent, a specific node, or a Docker container.
stages: Defines the different steps or stages in the pipeline (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
steps: Commands to be executed in each stage.


2. Scripted Pipeline::
   ==============

The scripted pipeline offers more flexibility, but it is less structured and can be harder to maintain. It uses Groovy syntax to define the pipeline.

Here's an example of a scripted pipeline:

node {
    try {
        stage('Build') {
            echo 'Building the application...'
            // Your build commands here
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            echo 'Running tests...'
            // Your test commands here
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Deploying the application...'
            // Your deploy commands here
        }


        Please try to create one new jenkins pipeline job and execute below script for Scripted pipeline examples

        node {
        stage('Clone') {
                git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/parasa7358/onlinebookstore.git'
			}
			
			 stage('Build') {
        
                sh 'mvn package'
        
			}
			stage('Test') {
        
                sh 'mvn test'
        
			}
        }



  Key differences in a scripted pipeline:::
  ==================================
node: Represents a Jenkins agent where the pipeline will run.


07/03/2025::
===============

Pipeline as Code::
==================
Both declarative and scripted pipelines are stored as Jenkinsfiles, which you place in your source code repository. This allows you to version control your pipeline and keep it aligned with your application code.

Declarative pipeline with Jenkinsfile::
===============================

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'git@github.com:parasa7358/spring-petclinic.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn package'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Test Results Reports') {
            steps {
                junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Artifacts') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.war', followSymlinks: false
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}


This pipeline:::

1 Checks out the source code from your Git repository.
2. Builds the project using Maven.
3.Runs unit tests.
4.Deploys the application using a custom script.

Tomcat Web Server: Introduction
===============

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is primarily used to serve Java applications and is one of the most popular servlet containers in the world.

Tomcat is an essential tool for anyone working with Java web applications. It provides a simple, reliable platform for deploying and managing Java Servlets and JSPs and is widely used in both development and production environments. Its ease of use, combined with powerful features and flexibility, makes it an ideal choice for many developers working on Java-based web applications.

Apache Tomcat is an open-source web server and servlet container that is primarily used to serve Java-based web applications. It implements several Java EE (Enterprise Edition) specifications, such as Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket, among others. Tomcat is often used to run Java applications on the web because it's lightweight, easy to configure, and widely supported.

Here are some key points about Tomcat:

1. **Servlet Container**: Tomcat is a servlet container, meaning it manages the lifecycle of Java Servlets, which are small Java programs that run on a web server.
  
2. **JSP Support**: Tomcat also supports JavaServer Pages (JSP), a technology that allows for embedding Java code within HTML pages.

3. **Configuration**: It’s highly configurable through XML files, like `server.xml` for server settings, `web.xml` for application settings, and others.

4. **Lightweight**: Unlike full-fledged application servers like WildFly (formerly JBoss) or GlassFish, Tomcat is primarily a servlet and JSP container, which makes it lighter and easier to deploy for simpler Java web applications.

5. **Performance**: It’s known for good performance in handling static content, making it a popular choice for Java web developers.


Integrate Jenkins with Tomcat::
==============================



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d3919a7-585b-4737-9d60-95207ca08ad8)


Integrating Tomcat with Jenkins is a common use case for automating the deployment of Java-based web applications. Jenkins can be set up to deploy a web application to a Tomcat server whenever a new build is triggered.

Prerequisites:

Apache Tomcat should be installed and running on your server.
Jenkins should be installed and running.

Steps to integrate Jenkins with Tomcat:

1. Install the "Deploy to Container" Plugin in Jenkins:
The easiest way to deploy to Tomcat from Jenkins is by using the Deploy to Container plugin. This plugin allows Jenkins to deploy WAR files to a Tomcat server.

Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
Click on Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
In the Available tab, search for Deploy to Container Plugin and install it.
Once installed, restart Jenkins to apply the plugin.

2. Configure Tomcat Server in Jenkins:
Now you need to tell Jenkins where your Tomcat server is running.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System.
Scroll down to the Deploy to container section.
Click Add Tomcat Server.

Provide the necessary information:
Name: Give the Tomcat server a name (Tomcat9).
URL: The URL of your Tomcat server (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Username: The username for Tomcat's manager app (usually admin).
Password: The password for that username (set in Tomcat's tomcat-users.xml).
Save the configuration.

3. Configure Tomcat’s tomcat-users.xml:
Make sure Tomcat is set up to allow Jenkins to deploy the application by editing the tomcat-users.xml file.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7763560/401-unauthorized-error-while-logging-in-manager-app-of-tomcat

tomcat-users.xml file::
=========================

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61a0b6ae-1e6c-47d0-8852-b226d65f38a4)



  <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
  <role rolename="manager-script"/>
  <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
  <role rolename="manager-status"/>
  <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
  <role rolename="admin-script"/>
  <user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui, manager-script, manager-jmx, manager-status, admin-gui, admin-script"/>




Restart Tomcat to apply the changes.

4. Create a Jenkins Job to Build and Deploy the Application:
Next, you need to create a Jenkins job that will build your web application (e.g., a WAR file) and deploy it to Tomcat.

From the Jenkins dashboard, click New Item.

Select Freestyle Project, give it a name, and click OK.

In the job configuration, go to the Build section and configure your build step, such as building a Maven project For Maven, you can use:

> mvn clean install

In the Post-build Actions section, add Deploy war/ear to a container.

In the WAR/EAR files field, provide the path to your WAR file (e.g., target/my-app.war).
In the Container field, choose the Tomcat server you configured earlier.
Set the Context Path (e.g., IfocusAWSDevOpsTraining), which is the URL path where the application will be accessible on Tomcat.
If you want Jenkins to deploy automatically after every successful build, check the option Deploy after every successful build.
Save the job.

5. Trigger the Build and Deployment:
Go to the Jenkins job you just created and click Build Now to trigger a build.
After the build completes, Jenkins should deploy the WAR file to your Tomcat server.

You can access your application by going to http://<tomcat_host>:<tomcat_port>/<context_path>

example::  http://localhost:8080/IfocusApplication/

POLL SCM:: * * * * * (every minute automatic build & deployment happend when new commits happend in github)
This setup will allow Jenkins to automatically build and deploy your Java web application to Tomcat with each new build
